#textdomain wesnoth-A_Rough_Life

# proposed background: In the time of Black-Eye Karun's legacy, the orcs grew very organized and bold and developed a vast network of slavers that visited every coast in an attempt to fund the orc empire. Sometime in the YW 845, one of these slavers happend along a stretch of cost along the western edge of the peninsula forming the Bay of Pearls. This peninsula was a desolate place compared to the bustling center of Wesnoth, off the busy trade routes, where a small population of humans scrabbled for a meager existence: a perfect target for orc slavers. The tiny village of Mosh is situated in this backwater, near enough to the sea for it's villagers to be familiar with it and to have some knowledge of boats. But being too far inland to get a living from the sea, the villagers scratched in the rocky soil to grow their poor crops and became themselves hard and mean. Smugglers worked the coast and the area was rife with bandits and ruffians. On the other side of the world, four hundred years before the Golden age of the Kingdom of Wesnoth, a small kingdom arose in a lush and fertile land and, due to a brisk local sea trade, prospered and grew for all of those four hundred years: the small kingdom of Rutuba Pinguiyum. But as Wesnoth reached its peak in peace and prosperity in a Golden Age of expansion, Rutuba Pinguiyum was already in decline, its borders contracting, until, on the death of the ancient king in YW 239, a new and much smaller state took its place: Kythonia. It is here, a little more than six hundred years later, that our story takes place. But it all begins in the tiny village of Mosh.
